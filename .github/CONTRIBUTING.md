Please use brackets everywhere and don't remove them even if it would be possible. Here an example:

Good:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    if(args.length == 0) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

Bad:

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
{
    if(args.length == 0)
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
}
```
